### background  :bell:
- The No Tickets Found (NTF) status appears when tickets have sold out for the selected event.
- The aim of NTF is to direct customers to others dates and platinum if available.
- If tickets are available on Seatwave, these will also be shown, however priority is to sell all primary tickets(other dates and platinum) first.
